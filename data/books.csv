<p>It’s a group biography that weaves the stories of legendary British officer T.E. Lawrence, who played a key role in the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Turks during World War I; German Curt Prufer, who conspired with the Ottomans; Zionist agronomist Aaron Aaronsohn, who made the desert bloom; and American oil company representative William Yale, who spied for the State Department. Yale is the least accomplished character, but the hapless American gives Anderson the grist to deliver his verdict on U.S. policy then and now. Analyzing a muddled dispatch Yale sent to Washington, Anderson writes: “He was establishing a tradition of fundamentally misreading the situation in the Middle East that his successors in the American intelligence community would rigorously maintain for the next 95 years.” This is a book about muddling and meddling. It couldn’t come at a better time.</p>",

But more than that, it's about feeling lost &mdash; because of bullying, because of abuse, because of race &mdash; and feeling loved. It captures the pure, visceral thrill of a high school swoon, but it never forgets that those feelings are real and important. Rowell's willingness to portray real ugliness and real pain means that when Eleanor and Park are daring to hope for something wonderful for themselves, the stakes feel enormous. It's called a young adult book, and indeed, it's a fine thing to give a sensitive kid. But there's nothing unsophisticated or less than serious about this empathetic, beautifully rendered novel.",

It was the challenge that excited her, and even though the one school that accepted her application did it as a joke, she not only made it through the program, but graduated first in her class. Filled with humor, lively text and charming illustrations, this one could inspire many readers to challenge themselves as well. (For ages 5 to 8)",0.559450939
Have You Seen My New Blue Socks?,205,"Eve Bunting, Sergio Ruzzier",Mara Alpert,http://www.lapl.org/collections-resources/blogs/central-library/authors/malpert,"children's librarian, Los Angeles Public Library",Beth,0547752679,TRUE,246032226,,,Kids' Books,Preschool,"Poor Duck has lost his new blue socks. He searches through his toy box, asks various pals, like Fox (who sits beside a grapevine reading a book in a nice nod to Aesop) and the very artistic Mr. Ox, who suggests Duck check out the socks on the rocks, which sadly are more purple than blue. It is the littlest peacock whose sharp eyes find those pesky blue socks. An excellent choice for a newly minted reader, with some fine humorous touches in both the brief rhyming couplets and the somewhat Seussian watercolor illustrations. (For ages 4 to 8)",0.278147383

We all know the story of the little piggies who went to market and ate roast beef and so on ... but what about the piggies on the other foot? Those piggies were dancing, flying planes and exploring the universe! Now the original wee-weeing-all-the-way-home piggies want to do more fun stuff, too. Soon they are throwing costume parties, chewing gum and secretly becoming Super Toe, the world’s greatest hero! Of course, all this activity is exhausting, so the piggies get ready for bed and go z-z-z ... all the way to sleep. Everyone’s toes should have this much fun. (For ages 4 to 8)",0.561228494

A quiet white rabbit in the middle of an orange page stares a little apprehensively at the loud lion that pops up from behind the opposing flap.

Flora, a plump little girl in a pink swimsuit, bathing cap and flippers, approaches the artiste with bravery and wonderful determination. Words aren’t necessary (or included) as the dance commences. Flaps are lifted to show each dancer’s reactions. Midway through it is obvious that the flamingo has resigned herself to teaching this strange new creature, and by the end they share an enthusiastic friendship. This book is graceful, goofy and positive on so many levels. (For ages 4 to 6)",0.355704166

Young Alex wields a devastating pen as he transforms a book about the ooshy, gooshy ""Birthday Bunny"" into a book about the bloodthirsty, evil genius ""Battle Bunny,"" whose nefarious plans for destroying the world can only be stopped by one person ... Alex himself. This one has everything &mdash; Shaolin Bear and Ninja Turtle, a special Evil Plan Place (because everyone needs an Evil Plan Place.

Meet Microraptor, a deadly hunter smaller than a modern-day chicken! Some dinosaurs were the size of dogs or horses or SUVs. Of course, all the way at the other end of the scale, there was Argentinosaurus, as long as four school buses, and probably the largest animal ever to walk on land (but only a predator if you happened to be a tree).

Every Grain Of Rice: Simple Chinese Home Cooking,216,Fuchsia Dunlop,Brian Boyer,,NPR Visuals Editor ,Rose,"0393089045

",,176069849,,,"NPR Staff Picks, Cookbooks & Food",,"Fuchsia Dunlop's books on Chinese cooking are authentic, accessible and fun to read. Her latest, <em>Every Grain Of Rice,</em> is sort of like a <em>Joy Of Cooking</em> for homestyle Chinese food, chock-full of delicious, simple recipes. More important, she helps you learn a new cuisine by demystifying the tools and techniques and teaching you how to stock your Chinese-friendly pantry. And because the Chinese diet is often low-meat and flavored with meaty-but-not-meat ingredients like fermented beans, it's great for vegetarians and vegans. There's no better introduction to Chinese cooking. I love this book.",

And in these caves, the locals built “telling rooms,” places to count the stored casks of wine and the cheeses -- and to tell tall tales and family stories. <em>The Telling Room</em> is Michael Paterniti’s deeply personal, deliciously idiosyncratic account of his search for the legendary Paramo de Guzman cheese and the man who created it, Ambrosio Molinos.  Molinos had a marvelous story: He had created the cheese, made it a success, and then been betrayed by his best friend and business partner -- or was he?  It’s a story of love, betrayal and revenge, yes -- but also a story about the power of stories to reshape reality.  And, of course, really great cheese. ",
